                       A <strong>Public Limited Company (PLC)</strong> is a business entity that offers its shares to the public and can be listed on a stock exchange. It is governed by the <strong>Companies Act, 2013,</strong> and is ideal for large businesses that aim to raise capital from the public through <strong>Initial Public Offerings (IPO).</strong> We provide expert assistance in <strong>Public Limited Company Registration,</strong> ensuring complete compliance with all regulatory requirements.
