                        <p>
                        The resignation of a partner involves updating the partnership deed or LLP agreement, informing regulatory authorities, and filing necessary forms with the <strong>Registrar of Firms</strong> or <strong>Registrar of Companies (ROC).</strong> Mistakes or delays in filing can lead to penalties and disputes. We ensure accurate documentation, quick filing, and compliance with all legal formalities.
