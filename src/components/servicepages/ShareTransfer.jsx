                        <p>
                        Share transfer is the process of transferring ownership of shares from one person or entity to another. This is a common practice in private limited companies when shareholders wish to sell or transfer their shares to new or existing shareholders. Proper documentation and compliance with the <strong>Companies Act, 2013</strong> are essential to ensure the smooth transfer of shares. We offer expert assistance to streamline the entire share transfer process, minimizing legal hassles and delays.

                        Transferring shares involves legal formalities, including drafting share transfer deeds, paying stamp duty, and filing necessary forms with the <strong>Registrar of Companies (ROC).</strong> Any mistake or omission can lead to compliance issues and penalties. We ensures that the transfer is carried out efficiently and in full compliance with legal requirements.
