                        <p>
                        Winding up a company is the legal process of closing down its operations and distributing its assets to pay off liabilities. It marks the official closure of the business and the removal of the company's name from the <strong>Registrar of Companies (ROC).</strong> Whether voluntary or by tribunal order, winding up requires meticulous documentation, compliance with legal provisions, and coordination with stakeholders. We provide end-to-end support for a seamless and compliant winding-up process.

                        <p>
                        Winding up a company involves multiple steps, including board resolutions, creditor meetings, preparation of winding-up petitions, and compliance with the Companies Act, 2013. Mistakes or delays can lead to legal complications and penalties. We ensure that every step is executed accurately and in compliance with statutory requirements.
