                        Winding Up of an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) is the process of dissolving the partnership, which involves settling its liabilities, distributing remaining assets among partners, and filing necessary documents with the regulatory authorities to officially close the LLP.

                        <p>
                        Winding up of a <strong>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong> is the legal process of closing down its operations and distributing its assets to settle liabilities. It results in the formal dissolution of the LLP and removal of its name from the <strong>Registrar of Companies (ROC).</strong> The winding-up process can be either <strong>voluntary</strong> or <strong>compulsory,</strong> depending on the circumstances. We provide expert assistance in executing the winding-up process efficiently and in full compliance with the law.
